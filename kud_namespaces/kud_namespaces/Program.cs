//namespaces help organize your program and provide assistance in avoiding name clashes in very large programs.
// Using directives are different namespaces, a using statememnt is easier to type than a qualified name
//it is important to know that namespaces do not correspond to file, directory or assembly names. They could be written in seperate files and/or seperate assemblies and still belong to the same namespace.
